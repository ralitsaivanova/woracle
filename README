Hello!

The docker-compose file starts two containers:
- api - will allow you to look at the docs and 
try out the API. Start the container with 
```
docker-compose up api
```
and head to http://0.0.0.0/docs/

- test-api - runs the tests when you start the container. 
Seemed like an easy way to show you the test run without 
much typing

```
docker-compose up test-api
```



I have never used fastapi before and it was a really nice experience.
It combines the best of python capabilities and best practices that
have not been an afterthought but part of the reason it was created.
